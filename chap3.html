								Research Design
							</p>
							The research design used in this study was quantitative research design. Quantitative research is the process of collecting and analyzing numerical data. It can be used to find patterns and averages, make predictions, test causal relationships, and generalize results to wider populations. The researcher used experimental research design in this study. An experimental research is a scientific method that involves conducting controlled experiments to test hypotheses and investigate cause-and-effect relationships. The research is based on tracking and monitoring Grade 12 ICT students research activities.

						<h1 style="text-align: left;"> <p  style="text-align: left; color: #778da9; margin-bottom: 10px;">
							Research Instrument
							</p>
							The researcher will use a survey questionnaire created specifically to assess participants' opinions and experiences with tracking and monitoring devices in a setting of education. The aim of the questionnaire is to gather information on a variety of topics, such as usage, effectiveness, and potential advantages of such systems. The participants of the study will be asked to provide their responses to the survey questionnaire, which will be made available through a provided link or a Google Form.
							Additionally, the participants will be allowed to freely discuss their personal opinions and experiences regarding the use of tracking and monitoring technology, as will the researchers. This will make it possible to completely understand the participants' viewpoints and give the study useful qualitative data.

							Research Respondents
							</p>
							The respondents of this research are Grade 12 ICT students of AMA Santa Cruz in the school year of 2022-2023. The researcher used all the Grade 12 ICT students to conduct the research. The respondents were Grade 12 ICT students since they are the ones who are experiencing the research activities.

						Sampling Techniques
							</p>
							The researcher utilized convenience sampling, a non-probability sampling technique where participants are based on their accessibility and ease of inclusion which entails selecting units based on their accessibility and ease of inclusion. This technique also depends on the willingness of individuals to participate in the study. The researchers opted to use this sampling technique to gather information from grade 11 and grade 12 students at ama Sta Cruz campus as they were deemed valuable sources of information for the study.

						<h1 style="text-align: left;"> 
							<p style="text-align: left; color: #778da9; margin-bottom: 10px;">
							Data Gathering Procedure
							</p>
							The first step to be used is to ask permission from the teacher of the Grade 12 ICT of AMA Santa Cruz to conduct the survey. The researcher will personally administer the distribution of questioners during the available time of the students so that their classes will not be disturbed. This was also done to ensure that the questionnaire would not be retrieved promptly. After the respondents answer the questionnaire, the researcher will collect and analyze the data for interpretation.

							Statistical Treatment
							</p>
							To assess the satisfaction and effectiveness of the tracking and monitoring system, we will collect data from 30 voluntary students from AMA. The data will be gathered through a survey that includes rating scales for both satisfaction and effectiveness.
							The satisfaction rating scale will range from 1 to 5, where 1 represents very dissatisfied, 2 represents dissatisfied, 3 represents neutral, 4 represents satisfied, and 5 represents very satisfied. The effectiveness rating scale will also range from 1 to 5, where 1 represents not effective at all, 2 represents slightly effective, 3 represents moderately effective, 4 represents "effective, and 5 represents highly effective.
				 
				 t =((Mean1 - Mean2))/█(√((Standard (Deviation1^2)/30)+ (Standard Deviation2²/30))@)
				 where:
							 Mean1 represents the mean of the first variable (satisfaction score).
							 Mean2 represents the mean of the second variable (helpfulness score).
							 Standard Deviation1 represents the standard deviation of the first variable (satisfaction score).
							 Standard Deviation2 represents the standard deviation of the second variable (helpfulness score).
							30 represents the sample size for both the satisfaction and helpfulness scores (assuming there are 30 respondents).
						  You can determine the statistical significance of the difference between the satisfaction and helpfulness scores among the 30 respondents by substituting the actual values of Mean1, Mean2, Standard Deviation1, Standard Deviation2, n1 (30 for satisfaction score), and n2 (30 for helpfulness score), and calculating the t-value using the provided formula.
