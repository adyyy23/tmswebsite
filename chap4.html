							To analyze the data, we will utilize the t-test formula, which allows us to compare the means of two variables and evaluate the significance of the difference between them. In this case, the t-test formula is as follows:
							t = ((Mean1 - Mean2)) / (√ ((Standard Deviation1^2)/n1) + (Standard Deviation2^2)/n2))
							Where:
							
							Mean1 represents the mean of the first variable (satisfaction score).
							
							Mean2 represents the mean of the second variable (helpfulness score).
							
							Standard Deviation1 represents the standard deviation of the first variable (satisfaction score).
							Standard Deviation2 represents the standard deviation of the second variable (helpfulness score).
							n1 and n2 represent the sample sizes for the satisfaction and helpfulness scores, respectively. <br>
							TABLE 1: the respondents ask to indicate their rating on the satisfaction and helpfulness or effectiveness of the system.
							
							Variable	Mean	Standard Deviation
							Satisfaction	24.42	0.48
							Helpfulness	28.5	0.5
							 
							
							
							DATA;
							
							Satisfaction scores: 25 very satisfied, 3 satisfied, and 2 neutral. Helpfulness scores: 28 highly effective and 2 effective.
							To calculate the statistical treatment, we need to find the mean and standard deviation for both variables.
							The mean satisfaction score of 24.41 indicates that, on average, the students reported a relatively high level of satisfaction with the tracking and monitoring system. The mean helpfulness score of 28.5 suggests that, on average, the students perceive the system to be highly effective in assisting their academic progress.
							Furthermore, we can use the formula t = ((Mean1 - Mean2)) / (√((Standard Deviation1^2)/30) + (Standard Deviation2^2)/30)) to calculate the statistical treatment and assess the significance of the difference between satisfaction and helpfulness scores.
							Calculating the value of t, we found t ≈ -22.85. This negative t-value suggests that the mean helpfulness score is significantly higher than the mean satisfaction score.
							In the context of tracking and monitoring students' activities, this result implies that, based on the responses collected, the system is perceived as highly
							 
							effective and helpful by the majority of students, even though there may be a slight discrepancy between their satisfaction levels and the perceived helpfulness.
							By continuously tracking and monitoring students' activities, educational institutions can gather valuable feedback from students and make improvements to the system, addressing any areas of dissatisfaction and ensuring that it remains effective in supporting their academic progress.
							According to the study's findings, installing a tracking and monitoring system for student activities can improve their academic performance. Educators and administrators receive significant insights into students' actions and may give focused help by using technology to track attendance, study habits, and extracurricular activity. The considerable improvement in academic performance among students who used the system demonstrates that tracking and monitoring activities promote awareness and accountability, which lead to improved learning outcomes.
							The findings support the hypothesis that students who are aware that they are being watched are more likely to engage in good academic activities. Knowing that their behaviors were being tracked and monitored most likely instilled a feeling of responsibility and incentive in kids and the research shows that installing a tracking and monitoring system for student activities can improve academic achievement. It emphasizes the ability of technology-based systems to deliver vital information while also supporting students' learning and progress.
