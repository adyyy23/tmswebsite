                            This particular chapter of the research work comprises an extensive and critical evaluation of literature and studies that the researcher analyzed to enrich the quality and value of the study. Moreover, the chapter offers a synthesis of the gathered information to promote a comprehensive understanding of the research, thereby enabling the readers to grasp the study's intricacies and complexities more effectively. <br>
                            Edmodo was founded in 2008 by Nicolas Borg and Jeff Oâ€™Hara. It is considered as a social networking site (very similar to Facebook) for teachers and students. It provides a secure and easy environment where pupils can share their content, and access several activities, evaluations and notices. Users can send and receive messages, discuss on forums and share digital resources such as videos, audios or images. All evaluations and grades are easily stored and accessible anytime. It can be accessible online and by mobile devices (including Android and iPhones). The platform is available in 6 languages including English, German, Greek, French, Spanish and Portuguese. In the first quarter of 2013, there were over 18.8 million people registered in over 90 countries. 85 of the largest US school districts have already chosen it. This literature is closely related to the current study because it helps the teachers and students to track and monitor their progress and activities. The present study like the article reviewed aims to provide a more easy way to track and monitor the students activities. <br>
                            The 2nd Multidisciplinary Research and Innovation for Globally Sustainable Development, Balmes (2016) said monitoring is a systematic collection and analysis of information for an individual activity. It is widely used in organizations like schools, to keep track of the day-to-day operations. However, there are times when the forms are not available. Hence, the submission of the day to day monitoring becomes a problem for most of the faculty. In this study, therefore, the researcher develops an online day to day monitoring system to assist the faculty for an easy and on-time submission of the day-to-day monitoring. It will also help the college dean to check quickly and monitor the submitted day to day monitoring forms because it is accessible anytime, anywhere. This literature is similar to the present study because the their goal is to develop a monitoring system for the students and teachers. The researchers want to make a monitoring system that will help their faculty members to have an easy day to day monitoring. <b>
                            Quality education is a fundamental right and is part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To achieve this goal, it is vital to promote school retention and prevent dropout. Monitoring systems are one of the recommended measures (Fredricks et al., 2019; Hofkens and Rozek, 2019; de Toro et al., 2021). They are referred to as educational trajectory protection systems or early warning and intervention systems. Regardless of their denomination, prevention and promotion only occur if detection is accompanied by a set of measures. UNESCO (2021) highlights how these systems can become effective tools for reducing dropout, and the importance of linking them with other educational management systems. <b>
                            Sophisticated and intricate evaluation mechanisms, known as student tracking systems, have the potential to provide an avenue for perpetual growth in the educational realm by offering the means to monitor and improve the ongoing learning process. Cito, as a potential solution, can aid in the development and implementation of these intricate tracking systems. C. Stauffer (2017). Moreover, the utilization of formative assessment methods can yield invaluable information regarding the areas of proficiency and inadequacy of learners, thereby empowering them to refine and optimize their educational endeavors. <b>
                                The concept of tracking and monitoring students' academic progress originated in the education sector. Educators and researchers have been using different assessment tools to gauge students' progress and identify areas where they may require additional support or resources. However, the advent of technology has allowed the development of more sophisticated tracking and monitoring systems that can collect and analyze significant amounts of data on several factors such as student performance, attendance, behavior, and others. These advanced systems have become a crucial aspect of modern education, allowing educators to provide personalized instruction that meets each student's unique needs and delivers better outcomes. <b>
                                    In the study of Vicente R. Abelardo P. Daniel B. Carlos K (2019) they stated that the ability of instructors to monitor the overall learning process and potentially act based on observed events is a vital component that adds to the success of a learning experience. In an ideal world, a teacher overseeing all events in a learning environment would be in a position to modify whatever settings are available to better the overall experience for the students. However, in today's educational institutions, this hypothetical scenario is still extremely distant from reality, and to make matters worse, there are multiple factors working against this goal. <b>
                                        In recent years, monitoring and tracking systems have become integral components of education. These systems use various assessment tools to collect and analyze data on student performance, attendance, behavior, and other relevant factors. The data collected through these systems helps educators to identify areas where students need additional support and resources, enabling them to provide more personalized and effective instruction to their students. The effectiveness of these systems is supported by research, which has shown that tracking and monitoring activities can lead to improved academic outcomes, such as higher grades, increased attendance, and reduced disciplinary incidents (S.Papavlaso, 2017). Furthermore, these systems can provide valuable insights into student learning, enabling educators to tailor their teaching strategies and improve their instructional practices. <b>
                                            Monitoring activities can be an effective tool for teachers to track their own professional development and make improvements to their teaching practices. Through self-monitoring, teachers can assess their teaching effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. Additionally, monitoring can be used by school administrators to evaluate teacher performance and provide support where necessary. Numerous studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of monitoring activities for teachers. These studies have found that teacher monitoring can lead to improvements in teaching practices and student achievement. However, the success of monitoring activities depends on the quality of the monitoring tools and the training provided to teachers. Moreover, monitoring can be particularly beneficial for teachers who work in remote or low-resource settings, where access to professional development opportunities may be limited. Online monitoring tools and platforms can provide teachers with access to resources and support from anywhere in the world (VV Abeele, 20190). Monitoring activities can be a powerful tool for teachers to improve their teaching practices and student outcomes. With the right tools and support, monitoring activities can help teachers to develop their skills, increase their effectiveness in the classroom, and provide better educational experiences for their students. <b>
                                                Negative perceptions of online courses can result in reduced motivation and persistence, leading to unfavorable learning outcomes. The review also covers several factors that influence performance and satisfaction in the online learning environment for adult learners, such as learning outcomes, instructional design, and learner characteristics. Additionally, the review provides recommendations for further research and concludes with implications for online learning, relevant to administrators, instructors, course designers, and students. It is crucial to identify the particular characteristics that contribute to online success or failure to predict possible learning outcomes accurately and prevent students from enrolling in online courses that are not suitable for them. Understanding these learner attributes can help faculty design quality online courses that meet students' needs. Adequate instructional methods, support, course structure, and design can promote student performance and satisfaction (Heather, 2017). <b>
                                                    Monitoring systems track and analyze multiple data points in order to measure performance, find areas for improvement, and make educated decisions. While creating a monitoring system may necessitate an initial commitment of time, resources, and effort, the advantages of the system frequently surpass the expenses. Monitoring systems can streamline data collecting and analysis by employing technology and automation, making the process more efficient and time-consuming. Furthermore, the monitoring system's insights can assist educators and administrators in making educated decisions, improving educational outcomes, and providing more personalized support to students. Finally, while adopting a monitoring system may necessitate a considerable initial expenditure, the long-term benefits it can give in terms of increasing student results outweigh the costs. In this study, the authors examined the role of interaction, specifically between learners and the instructor, content, and classmates, in online undergraduate-level courses. <b>
                                                        The researchers investigated the interplay between student background factors and course-related variables in 167 minority students, mostly African American working adults, enrolled in six online courses at a university in the southeastern United States. The findings revealed that learner-content interaction and learner-instructor contact were crucial factors in determining student satisfaction in situations where group activities were not available. Additionally, the study found that Internet self-efficacy was associated with three forms of interaction, and that student happiness was positively correlated with student performance. The authors also observed that student background characteristics (gender, age, hours spent online) had a greater impact on learner-instructor contact, while course-related variables (course length, course type, and the number of discussion forums) had a greater influence on learner-learner interaction (S. Dhawan, 2020). <b>
                                                            A monitoring system can be a beneficial tool for students, providing them with individualized support and timely feedback to aid in their academic success. Students can track their progress and find areas for development by using a monitoring system. They can get immediate feedback on assignments and tests, allowing them to fine-tune their learning tactics and enhance their performance. A monitoring system can also provide personalized recommendations to pupils based on their own learning requirements and preferences. A monitoring system can help students stay motivated and interested in their studies by offering tailored support, as they earn recognition and a sense of satisfaction for their achievements. <b>
                                                                A tracking system can provide numerous benefits to educators, students, and parents. For example, it can assist educators in identifying individual students' strengths and weaknesses and delivering focused interventions to improve student learning results. It can also help educators evaluate student progress and provide timely feedback, increasing student engagement and motivation. Furthermore, it can assist instructors in making data-driven decisions and effectively allocating resources to enhance student development (M Fantigrassi,2018). <b>
                                                                    Nevertheless, there are certain disadvantages to using a tracking system. Data 
                                                                    privacy and security are major considerations, as such systems necessitate the collecting and storage of sensitive student data. Data misuse is also a risk, particularly if the system is not properly secured or the data is not handled ethically. Furthermore, using a tracking system might lead to a restricted concentration on test scores and academic outcomes, while ignoring larger components of student learning such as creativity, critical thinking, and social-emotional development. Furthermore, some critics contend that tracking systems can reinforce existing prejudices and inequities, continuing discrimination against specific student groups such as low-income or minority pupils. <b>
                                                                        Mavroudi (2017) conducted a systematic review  to identify the relationship between Learning Analytics (LA) and adaptive learning in promoting learner-centered education through technology. The study examined twenty-one peer-reviewed articles and proposed a framework for classifying the findings. The study highlights the need for further research in specific learning domains and settings, with recommendations including the use of a clear strategy for adaptation augmented by LA, the combination of on-task with pre-task measures, and the combination of system-controlled adaptation with user-controlled adaptation. The author also predicts the emergence of constructivist-collaborative environments that provide insightful models of complex student behavior as a future trend. <b>
